# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of **ozone**. Ozone is a tool to solve **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** in the context of multi-disciplinary design optimization. The solution of ODEs are often needed within a larger model. Further, for gradient-based optimization, the derivatives are often needed. Ozone integrates these ordinary differential equations and automatically chains derivatives through the time dimension. 

It is built around the **CSDL** framework.

A wide array of **numerical methods** are available.

Several different **solution approaches** can be used to solve the problem.
