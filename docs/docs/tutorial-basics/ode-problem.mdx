# ODEProblem Class

There are two important classes the user must define when using `ozone`: the class defining the ODE function and the class defining the ODE problem.
In this section, we will go over how to properly define the ODEProblem. 

The ODEProblem class organizes the variables to create a solver model that integrates the ODE.

See the [general example](/advanced/general-example) to see all methods being called.
