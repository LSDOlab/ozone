# ODE Function

## CSDL and Vectorization

There are two important classes the user must define when using `ozone`: the class defining the ODE function and the class defining the ODE problem.
In this section, we will go over how to properly set the ODE function. 

As stated earlier, an ODE has the form

$$
\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{t}} = f(x,y).
$$

A `csdl` model must be created to represent the above system. 

However, the `csdl` model must be build with **vectorization** in mind.
In essence, the `csdl` model have the capability to evaluate $f(x,y)$ **multiple** times with different values of $x$ and $y$ in one evaluation.
So from the user perspective, we give inputs: n = `num_nodes` values of $y$ and n = `num_nodes` values of $x$ and outputs: n = `num_nodes` of $f$ corresponding to each input.

Some examples:

## 1. $f(x,y) = -y$

Notice the vectorization with `n = self.parameters['num_nodes']`.
The `initialize(self)` method with `self.parameters.declare('num_nodes')` is required.

```py
# CSDL Model defining dydt = -y
class ODESystemModel(csdl.Model):
    def initialize(self):
        # Required every time, the vectorization number
        self.parameters.declare('num_nodes')

    def define(self):
        # Required every time, the vectorization number
        n = self.parameters['num_nodes']

        # State y. All ODE states must have shape = (n, .. shape of state ...)
        y = self.declare_variable('y', shape=n)

        # What is num_nodes? n = num_nodes allows vectorization of the ODE:
        # for example, for n = 3:
        # [dy_dt1[0]]           [-y[0]]
        # [dy_dt1[1]]     =     [-y[1]]
        # [dy_dt1[2]]           [-y[2]]
        # This allows the integrator to call this model only once to evaluate the ODE function 3 times instead of calling the model 3 separate times.
        # num_nodes is purely implemented by the integrator meaning the user does not need to know what the value of n = num_nodes is.

        # Compute output dy/dt = -y
        # y is a vector of size n, so dydt is a vector of size n
        dy_dt = -y

        # Register output
        self.register_output('dy_dt', dy_dt)
```

## 2. $f(x,y) = -x(t)y$

In this example, a *dynamic* parameter $x(t)$ is in the ODE Function.  **Dynamic parameters must also be vectorized.**

```py
# CSDL Model defining dydt = -y
class ODESystemModel(csdl.Model):
    def initialize(self):
        # Required every time, the vectorization number
        self.parameters.declare('num_nodes')

    def define(self):
        # Required every time, the vectorization number
        n = self.parameters['num_nodes']

        # State y. All ODE states must have shape = (n, .. shape of state ...)
        y = self.declare_variable('y', shape=n)
        x = self.declare_variable('x', shape=n)

        # Compute output dy/dt = -x*y
        # x,y is a vector of size n, so dydt is a vector of size n
        dy_dt = -x*y

        # Register output
        self.register_output('dy_dt', dy_dt)
```

## 3. $f(x,y) = -xy$
In this example, a *static* parameter $x$ is in the ODE Function.  **Static parameters are NOT vectorized.**

```py
# CSDL Model defining dydt = -y
class ODESystemModel(csdl.Model):
    def initialize(self):
        # Required every time, the vectorization number
        self.parameters.declare('num_nodes')

    def define(self):
        # Required every time, the vectorization number
        n = self.parameters['num_nodes']

        # State y. All ODE states must have shape = (n, .. shape of state ...)
        y = self.declare_variable('y', shape=n)
        x = self.declare_variable('x')

        # Compute output dy/dt = -x*y
        # y is a vector of size n, and x is a scalar so dydt is a vector of size n
        dy_dt = -x*y

        # Register output
        self.register_output('dy_dt', dy_dt)
```

## NativeSystem

There is an alternative method to defining ODE functions using the NativeSystem class with more details in the [advanced section](../advanced/nativsystem-odes).
NativeSystem ODEs are much faster (for now) than CSDL ODEs but require more work from the user to implement.
