# Simple Example

To get an intuition on how to solve an ODE problem with `ozone`, lets walk through a simple example.

## The Problem

Let's start by defining a simple ODE that we want to integrate,

$$
\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{t}} = -y, \quad y_0 = 0.5.
$$

We want to integrate it from $t = 0$ to $t = 3$ using 4th order Runge-Kutta (RK4). With the problem defined, let's see how to implement this in `ozone`.

## Defining the ODE function.

We represent our ODE function $-y$ as a `csdl` **Model()**. For those unfamiliar, `csdl` is an Embedded Domain Specific Language framework for modeling systems. For details, visit the csdl website.

Our csdl `Model` takes in the state $y$ as an input and outputs $dydt$:

```py
import csdl

class ODESystemModel(csdl.Model):
    def initialize(self):
        # Required every time for ODE systems or Profile Output systems
        self.parameters.declare('num_nodes')

    def define(self):
        # Required every time for ODE systems or Profile Output systems
        n = self.parameters['num_nodes']

        # State y. All ODE states must have shape = (n, .. shape of state ...)
        y = self.create_input('y', shape=n)

        # Register output dy/dt = -y
        self.register_output('dy_dt', -y)

```

## Creating the Solver Model

We now have to create a separate `csdl` model that creates our integrator.

First, let's define the inputs to the ODE: initial condition $y_0 = 0.5$ and the timestep vector.
The timestep vector is a vector of stepsizes to integrate over. Let's use a timestep of 0.01s. 
This means the timestep vector is [0.01, 0.01, ... 0.01, 0.01] with 30 elements to go from $t = 0$ to $t = 3$. 
Both of these must be `csdl` variables.

Next, we will create the ODE solver model. Import the `ODEProblem` class from `ozone.api`. 
Instantiate the class with three arguments:
- Numerical Method (RK4)
- Solution Approach (Timemarching)
- Number of timesteps (30)

We then set the state, time vector and the ODE function. Finally, we create the solver model.

```py
import numpy as np
from ozone.api import ODEProblem

# The CSDL Model containing the ODE integrator
class RunModel(csdl.Model):

    def define(self):
        num_times = 31
        dt = 0.1

        # Create inputs to the ODE
        # Initial condition for state
        self.create_input('y_0', 0.5)

        # Timestep vector
        h_vec = np.ones(num_times-1)*dt
        self.create_input('h', h_vec)

        # Create ODEProblem class
        ode_problem = ODEProblem('RK4', 'time-marching', num_times)
        ode_problem.add_state('y', 'dy_dt', initial_condition_name='y_0', output='y_integrated')
        ode_problem.add_times(step_vector='h')
        ode_problem.set_ode_system(ODESystemModel)

        # Create CSDL Model of solver
        self.add(ode_problem.create_solver_model())
```

## Running the Model

We can then run our `csdl` model. Let's also compute the derivative of the outputs with respect to the inputs.
The output `y_integrated` is a vector of the solved state at each timestep.

```py
import python_csdl_backend

# Simulator object:
sim = python_csdl_backend.Simulator(RunModel(), mode='rev')

# Run and check derivatives
sim.prob.run_model()
print('y integrated:', sim.prob['y_integrated'])
sim.prob.check_totals(of=['y_integrated'], wrt=['y_0'], compact_print=True)
```
