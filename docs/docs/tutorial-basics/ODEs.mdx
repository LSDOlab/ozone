# ODE Review

An ODE is a differential equation of the form

$$
\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{t}} = f(x,y,t)
$$

with initial conditions $y(t=0) = y_0$ where
- $y$ consists of the state variables that are integrated,
- $t$ is the time variable, 
- $x$ are the parameters,
- $f$ is the ODE function. 


## Example

For example, Newton's law of cooling is

$$
\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{t}}= k(T − T_0)
$$

where
- $T$ is the scalar state variable that is being integrated,
- $t$ is the time variable, 
- $k$ and $T_0$ are parameters,
- $k(T − T_0)$ is the ODE function.
